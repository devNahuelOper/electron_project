          <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; I am a highly creative, goal-oriented and
            puzzle-loving coding aficionado, who finds immense satisfaction in
            constructing projects from the ground up, which is why I am thrilled
            at the prospect of joining <strong class="Company"></strong> as a
            <strong class="Position"></strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; I acquired my foundations at App Academy, where I
            spent 1,000+ hours mastering a primary stack consisting of Ruby,
            Ruby on Rails, JavaScript and React/Redux, along with other
            technologies such as: HTML5, CSS, Sass, jQuery, AJAX, SQL, SQLite,
            PostgreSQL, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose Git, AWS and
            Heroku.

            &nbsp; &nbsp; My time spent since July 2020, when I graduated from
            App Academy, is where I've gotten the chance to grow exponentially
            as a developer. While I attribute a sizable portion of this growth
            to a combination of taking additional courses and the continuous
            implementations of bigger and better features in my projects, it is
            my time working as a Junior Developer at Solvana
            <em> (an ecommerce solar energy startup)</em>, that has been most
            instrumental. In the past couple of months at Solvana, I've added
            several new technologies to my repertoire, such as TypeScript, AWS
            Lambdas, React Hooks, Material-UI and Jest, in addition to cementing
            my skills in all that is JavaScript/React/Redux.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; As a result of my technical prowess coupled with my
            tenacity for nonstop learning and improving, I’m confident I’d be a
            valuable asset as a <strong class="Position"></strong> at
            <strong class="Company"></strong>. As such, I look forward to
            speaking with you about any potential next steps.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          Thank you for your consideration.
